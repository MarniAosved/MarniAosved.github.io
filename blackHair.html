  <h1>Here are my main thoughts on We Need To Fix Black Hair in Video Games - The Blessing Show (in no particular order): </h1>
  <b></b>
  <p>
    <ul>
    <li>The idea that hairstyles for Black hair is an afterthought to most game developers demonstrates the internalized disregard the game development industry has for Black people.</li>
    <li>He brings up a friend who wants to do better in her company, but there are not any Black people working for them so they do not have a good idea of what is popular or pragmatic or cool for Black hair. <br>
        My immediate thought was that if they will not hire someone to permanently join the team, they should hire hair stylists/specialists to give their input. By paying people for their labor, they would  <br>
        be demonstrating that their ideas are valuable, and by taking the time to find specialists, they would demonstrate to the Black gaming community that the Black gaming community has value.</li>
    <li>He made the point that people should be calling out games online that have bad/limited hair styles for Black people to bring awareness to these issues. I am sure that people are already doing this,  <br>
        so what would he like people to do differently? Does he want to have more non-Black people call out these companies? Or is he just continuing to encourage people to do so?</li>
    <li>I appreciate him bringing his friend on the show to share her experiences with having her hair regulated in real life. I felt like that provided a very obvious context to why this issue is important  <br>
        to the gaming community. It is important that people can use games to express themselves and as an escape, and both are not possible if the same racism that people are potentially trying to escape by <br>
         being online is prevalent in character design.</li>
    <li>Animal crossing was brought up as a game that did not even allow users to customize their skin tone to an appropriate amount, which is an issue I was unaware of. I don’t play animal crossing, but for  <br>
        a while I saw people posting online frequently about their islands and their interactions with other characters. I can’t imagine how frustrating it would be to have spent so much time and energy  <br>
        designing your island only to be unable to feel like it’s actually yours because your avatar is unable to look like you. Skin color would be significantly easier to animate than hair, so having limited  <br>
        skin colors is frustrating.</li>
    </ul>
    Overall, I felt as though the video was clear that more work needs to be done to make Black players feel welcomed and appreciated in the gaming industry.
