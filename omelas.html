  <h1>Theses/Thoughts on Omelas </h1>
  <b></b>
  
  <p> <strong>Through The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas, Ursula Le Guin is able to invite the reader into a space where she acknowledges she does not fully understand in order to invoke questions <br>
  of morality without attempting to provide her own answer to those questions. This allows the reader to generate their own thoughts and work through their own frustrations without mindlessly accepting <br> 
  or rejecting Le Guin’s own position.</strong> These are a few of the questions I had while reading Omelas.<br><br><br>
  It appears as though everyone agrees that they cannot do anything for this child that they all acknowledge is suffering. Has anyone tried to do something? Or is the strength of their denial of their <br>
  role/acceptance of the narrative strong enough that they feel no need to take action? Le Guin states “They know compassion. It is the existence of the child, and their knowledge of its existence, that <br>
  makes possible” for all of the great and wonderful things about their society (4). Is that true, or are they compassionate because that has been modeled for them? The children that are too young to have <br>
  seen the child are still compassionate, no? Le Guin mentions that some people go to see the child, and others are simply aware of it and don’t ever see it. Are these people who have visited the child <br>
  and have some sort of experience with it more compassionate than the others who haven’t? I know that it is relatively easy to acknowledge that there are horrors going on in the world that enable us to <br>
  live our lives of relative luxury (children mining materials for smartphones in many areas in the world is an easy example) but that has not made us more compassionate. Does compassion mean seeing <br>
  suffering, and deciding to do better in your own small world rather than trying to stop the suffering? <br><br><br>
  I am sure many people focus on the people who walk away from Omelas. Where are they going? What are they doing? What did they notice? But I’m curious about what the people in Omelas think of those that<br>
  leave. Le Guin sees the leaving as “incredible,” but how do the occupants feel? Do they feel as though they were left behind or abandoned, or are they aware of the phenomenon and accept it just as they <br>
  accepted the suffering child? <br><br><br>

  By leaving most of the questions unanswered, Le Guin is able to encourage the readers to come to their own conclusions and analyze aspects of their reaction to this piece of literature organically, <br>
  without influencing those ideas or the process of discovery. However, this approach also allows those questions to go unanswered and ignored, regulated to just curiosities without any deeper meaning.<br>
